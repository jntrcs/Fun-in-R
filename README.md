"# Fun-in-R" 
# Fun-in-R

This is a collection of short demos (often simulations) that I have run in R. Many of them were to answer riddles posted weekly to fivethirtyeight.com.

I will also add some of the data sets I use in my scripts.

Also, as I get more into Python, "Fun-in-R" may be a poor name as I add Python code also.
