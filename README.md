# Fun-in-R

This is a collection of short demos (often simulations) that I have run in R. Many of them were to answer riddles posted weekly to fivethirtyeight.com.

Also I hope to start adding some interesting data sets. I recently added data collected from the LDS church's statistical report as well as a web scraped csv from worldometers.info
